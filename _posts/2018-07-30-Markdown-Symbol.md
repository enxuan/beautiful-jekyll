Mark down symbol is like html tag to determine text's format:

**_** : Make the text inside is italic
>EX: _this is italic text_
    
****** : make the text inside is bold
>EX: **this is bold text**
    
**#** : make the header level. how many symbol will stand for which header level (one symbol: header level 1, two symbol: header level two)

###This is header level three

**Link**: these are two kind of link: _inline link_ and _reference link_  
 * **Inline Link**: [text for the link] (link page)  
    we must write exactyly the link in link page
 * **reference link**: [text for the link] [reference link]  
    you must define the reference link at the end of file with fomat: [reference link]: the page link  
  * the advantage of this kind is we can change the link page just at the end of the file, not need to change every where the link page used.
